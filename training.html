                <h2>10 Proven Ways to Improve Your Reaction Time</h2>
                <p>Improving your reaction time requires consistent practice and proper technique. Here are research-backed methods:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Regular Practice with Varied Stimuli</h3>
                <p>Our game provides excellent practice by presenting targets at random intervals and locations. This variability is key to developing adaptable reflexes.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Focus on Anticipation</h3>
                <p>While pure reaction time has limits (about 150-200ms), anticipation can effectively reduce response time. Try to predict when and where the target might appear.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Get Adequate Sleep</h3>
                <p>Research shows reaction times slow by 10-30% when sleep-deprived. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep for optimal performance.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Stay Hydrated</h3>
                <p>Even mild dehydration (1-2% of body weight) can impair cognitive function and reaction time.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Incorporate Physical Exercise</h3>
                <p>Regular aerobic exercise improves blood flow to the brain and enhances cognitive function, including reaction time.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Try the "Go/No-Go" Method</h3>
                <p>This advanced technique involves responding to some stimuli while inhibiting responses to others, which trains your brain to make faster decisions.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Reduce Distractions</h3>
                <p>Practice in a quiet environment to maximize focus. Multitasking significantly slows reaction times.</p>
                
                <h3>8. Optimize Your Environment</h3>
                <p>Ensure good lighting and comfortable positioning. Poor ergonomics can slow your responses.</p>
                
                <h3>9. Track Your Progress</h3>
                <p>Use our game's scoring system to monitor improvements over time. Seeing progress is motivating!</p>
                
                <h3>10. Combine Physical and Mental Training</h3>
                <p>For sports applications, practice both cognitive exercises (like our game) and sport-specific drills.</p>
